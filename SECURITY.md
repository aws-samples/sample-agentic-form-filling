## Reporting Security Issues

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Report security issues via [AWS Vulnerability Reporting](https://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting/)
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability

## Security Best Practices

When using this sample code:

- Never commit credentials or secrets to version control
- Use AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive configuration
- Follow the principle of least privilege for IAM roles
- Enable encryption at rest and in transit
- Regularly update dependencies to patch vulnerabilities

## Supported Versions

This is sample code provided for demonstration purposes. Security updates are provided on a best-effort basis.
